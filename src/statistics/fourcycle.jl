"""
Four-cycle statistics for REM.

These statistics capture local clustering effects based on four-node structures,
measuring the closure of three-paths through two intermediate nodes.

"""
    FourCycle <: FourCycleStatistic

Measures four-cycle closure: tendency for s→r when there exist j, k such that
s→j, k→j, and k→r (or variants).

This captures local clustering where sender and receiver share connections
to a common pair of intermediaries.

# Fields
- `cycle_type::Symbol`: Type of four-cycle configuration.
    - :out_out: s→j←k→r (shared out-neighbor pattern)
    - :in_in: s←j→k←r (shared in-neighbor pattern)
    - :out_in: s→j→k→r (two-path through intermediaries)
    - :mixed: any configuration
- `weighted::Bool`: If true, weight by edge weights.
- `stat_name::String`: Name for this statistic.
