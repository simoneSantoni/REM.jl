"""
    REM.jl - Relational Event Models for Julia

A Julia implementation for statistical analysis of relational event networks.
Port of eventnet (https://github.com/juergenlerner/eventnet).

Relational Event Models (REM) are statistical models for analyzing sequences of
time-stamped relational events to uncover factors explaining why some actors
interact at higher rates than others.
